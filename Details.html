                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Toss the beef and flour together in a bowl with some salt and
                    black pepper. Heat a large casserole until hot, add half of the rapeseed oil and enough of the beef
                    to just cover the bottom of the casserole. Fry until browned on each side, then remove and set
                    aside. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef. Return the beef to the pan, add the wine and cook
                    until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the stock, onion, carrots, thyme and
                    mustard, and season well with salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and place in the oven for two hours.
                    Remove from the oven, check the seasoning and set aside to cool. Remove the thyme. When the beef is
                    cool and you're ready to assemble the pie, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Transfer the beef to
                    a pie dish, brush the rim with the beaten egg yolks and lay the pastry over the top. Brush the top
                    of the pastry with more beaten egg. Trim the pastry so there is just enough excess to crimp the
                    edges, then place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and
                    cooked through. For the green beans, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the beans and
                    cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and toss with the butter, then season with black
                    pepper. To serve, place a large spoonful of pie onto each plate with some green beans alongside.
